One approach is to completely retrain the chef from scratch to learn Chinese cuisine. However, this would take a lot of time and effort. Instead, you just teach the chef some specific recipes and techniques that are unique to Chinese cuisine, building on their existing knowledge of cooking. This approach is much faster and efficient. In machine learning, this process is akin to fine-tuning. You take a model that's already trained on a broad task (like the chef trained in Italian cuisine) and tweak it slightly to perform well on a more specific task (like cooking Chinese cuisine).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Introduction to QLoRA\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's introduce QLoRA into our analogy. Imagine the kitchen our chef works in is suddenly restricted in space and resources. The chef can't use all the fancy equipment and ingredients they're used to; they need to work efficiently with limited resources while still producing delicious meals. In the machine learning world, this scenario is similar to deploying models on devices with limited memory and processing power, like smartphones or small sensors. They can't handle the large, complex models we'd typically use on powerful servers. \n",
            "\n",
            "QLoRA is a technique that helps our \"chef\" (the model) adapt to working in this smaller \"kitchen\" (the device with limited resources) by focusing on the most critical \"recipes and techniques\" (parameters of the model) that are necessary for making \"delicious meals\" (making accurate predictions). It does so by quantizing and adapting only certain parts of the model in a low-rank manner, which essentially means finding the simplest, most efficient version of the model that still performs the task well.\n",
            "\n",
            "### How QLoRA Works\n",
            "\n",
            "Imagine if our chef decides to use a simplified set of kitchen tools that are essential for most Chinese dishes and learns to use them in the most efficient way possible, disregarding the rest. They might also use ingredients that are versatile and can be used across many dishes. In QLoRA, quantization is like picking the essential tools and ingredients - it reduces the \"size\" of the model by simplifying the numbers it uses to make calculations. The low-rank adaptation is like learning to use those tools in the most efficient way possible - it modifies the model slightly to ensure it can still perform well on the new cuisine despite the simplified toolkit.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Implementing QLoRA\n",
            "\n",
            "Implementing QLoRA involves two main steps:\n",
            "1. **Quantization**: This process simplifies the model by reducing the precision of the numbers it uses. Imagine telling our chef to use only half a dozen types of kitchen tools instead of dozens. This step makes the model much smaller and faster to run, but it could make it less accurate or versatile if not done carefully.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**: After quantization, some of the model's \"cooking skills\" might not be as sharp as before. To address this, low-rank adaptation tweaks the model's parameters (or its \"cooking techniques\") slightly to make the best use of its simplified toolkit. It's like our chef finding new shortcuts or techniques to make dishes taste great even with fewer tools and ingredients.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "QLoRA is a clever technique for making machine learning models more efficient, allowing them to run on devices with limited processing power without a significant loss in performance. It's like teaching an expert chef to work in a smaller kitchen with fewer tools and ingredients, yet still produce delicious meals. Understanding and implementing QLoRA can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool in the world of machine learning, especially for applications where resources are limited.\n"

The combination of these steps allows for efficient and effective fine-tuning of the model on a custom dataset. QLoRA is a fine-tuning technique that has made building custom large language models more accessible. Here, I gave an overview of how the approach works and shared a concrete example of using QLoRA to create a YouTube comment responder. They fine-tune over 1,000 models using QLoRA and analyze instruction following and chatbot performance across various datasets, model types (LLaMA, T5), and scales (33B and 65B parameters). Results show that QLoRA fine-tuning with a small high-quality dataset achieves state-of-the-art results, even with smaller models compared to previous state ... Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. In other words, you would need cloud computing to fine-tune your models. Now, with QLoRa (Dettmers et al., 2023), you could do it with only one A100. In this blog post, I will introduce QLoRa.

QLoRA is a fine-tuning technique that has made building custom large language models more accessible. Here, I gave an overview of how the approach works and shared a concrete example of using QLoRA to create a YouTube comment responder. They fine-tune over 1,000 models using QLoRA and analyze instruction following and chatbot performance across various datasets, model types (LLaMA, T5), and scales (33B and 65B parameters).

The parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LORA and QLORA pave the way for more accessible and practical deployment of LLMs across diverse applications. How QLoRA lets you fine-tune models that have billions of parameters on a relatively small GPU. QLoRA is a fine-tuning method that combines Quantization and Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). QLoRA is revolutionary in that it democratizes fine-tuning: it enables one to fine-tune massive models with billions of parameters on relatively small, highly available GPUs. To tackle catastrophic forgetting, strategies like task-specific multitask fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are discussed, with a focus on PEFT's memory efficiency.
